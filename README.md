# Ideas for the Open Challenge at [Make Zurich Vol. II](https://makezurich.ch)

Collect your ideas for the Open Challenge in the [issues](https://github.com/make-zurich/open-challenge-ideas/issues) of this repository. 
For each idea, open a separate issue.

You can be creative here. This is just for **brainstorming**. You can propose as many ideas as you like. You can comment on anyone's ideas (constructive comments). Please also add information on *what you need* (e.g. additional sensors).
You do not have to make any decision on which project you want to work on now. 
Teams will be formed on June 22nd at the event.

To get an idea about the platform we will work with, the hardware kits of the **open challenge** include a [The Things UNO](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/uno/) and a selection of sensors (e.g. GPS, temperature/humidity, motion, luminosity, relays, etc).
