**The idea** is to build a prototype hardware/software kit that allows students to experiment with GPS trackers,
both out in the field and also in the classroom. 
The kits can be offered to schools and camps as a 1 day free "rental". 

**The goal** is to increase student data & tech literacy, as well as support [computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking), as well as explain some physics like GPS and satellites.

**The project** is exciting for everyone - it's not only hardware, but also software, data, and creativity.

**The dream** is to generate some interest by building a kit prototype during Make Zurich,
then apply for some funding to do it proper. **Of course, all software and hardware would be 100% open source.** 

With this kit, multiple students would wear a GPS tracker and go out to a sports field to complete some tasks.
Tasks can be age dependent and include
+ spelling something out with their GPS traces (can be a team event, to each spell one letter)
+ do some walking and running at various speeds, and try to guess which animal they matched (from snail to cheetah)
+ *your ideas are needed! should be fun and not too competitive*

The kit, which can be delivered and returned by mail, may come with:
+ Teacher instructions and support
+ Handful of GPS sports trackers (light-weight, durable, etc)
+ Laptop pre-installed with code to extract data from trackers, Python Jupyter notebooks (or similar), data visualizations ready to go.
 + Of course, without a laptop would be better, perhaps with class's own laptop with [WebUSB](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/access-usb-devices-on-the-web) or class tablets and Bluetooth/WLAN. In this case, it would be better to develop mobile apps.
